## DevFast (.T to begin with...)
A power set of extension methods to increase developement productivity and allows you to write code faster and with confidence. It, as v1:
* On one hand, contains tons of methods on string, ValueType, Stream related to parsing (.TryTo, .To, .Trim etc), efficient transformation (.Transform, .To/.From etc)...
* On the other hand, proposes single liner statements to throw useful Exception (.ThrowIf, .ThrowIfNot, and other .Throw variants)...
* Method chaining is all the way...
